            <h3>About Corgi's</h3>
            <p>Originally bred to herd cattle, sheep, and horses, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is an active and intelligent dog breed.
                Easy to train and eager to learn, Pembrokes are great with children and other pets,
                and you can find them in four different coat colors and markings.<br><br>

                Welsh Corgis come in two varieties: the Pembroke and the Cardigan.
                They were registered as one breed by the Kennel Club in the U.K. until 1934,
                although many breeders believe the two breeds developed separately.
                Both have similar heads, bodies, levels of intelligence and herding ability,
                but the Cardigan is slightly larger and heavier boned than the Pembroke.<br><br>

                For most of us, the easiest way to tell the difference between a Pembroke and a Cardigan is to look at the tails.
                Pembrokes' are docked and Cardigans' are long.
                (Remember it this way: the Pembroke has a "broke" tail; the Cardigan has a long tail like the sleeves of a cardigan sweater.)<br><br>
