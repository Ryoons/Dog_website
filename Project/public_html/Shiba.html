            <h3>About Shiba's</h3>
            <p>The Shiba Inu dog breed was originally bred to flush birds and small game, and was occasionally used to hunt wild boar. 
                He is one of Japan’s six native breeds: Akita (large), Kishu, Hokkaido, Kai, Shikoku (medium), and Shiba (small). 
                He is known for his spirited personality, small upright ears, and cat-like agility.
                Today he serves primarily as a companion dog in Japan and the United States.<br><br>
                
                With his prick ears, squinty eyes, and curly tail, this breed from the Land of the Rising Sun looks like a fox, or perhaps a stuffed toy. 
                He is neither. He is the Shiba Inu, the smallest — and possibly the most ancient — of six spitz dogs that originate in Japan.<br><br>
                
                The Shiba Inu is known for a bold, fiery personality. 
                The Japanese have three words to describe the breed's mental traits: kaani-i (spirited boldness), ryosei (good nature), and soboku (alertness). 
                Combined, these traits make up the interesting, intelligent, and strong-willed temperament of this breed.<br><br>
